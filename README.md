### Usage
[![DEMO VIDEO](https://i.makeagif.com/media/5-20-2023/E4RfRM.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zCD48d3kNU)

CAAFE lets you semi-automate your feature engineering process based on your explanations on the dataset and with the help of language models. It is based on the paper "LLMs for Semi-Automated Data Science: Introducing CAAFE for Context-Aware Automated Feature Engineering" by Hollmann, Müller, and Hutter (2023).
CAAFE systematically verifies the generated features to ensure that only features that are actually useful are added to the dataset.

To use CAAFE, first create a CAAFEClassifier object with the desired parameters:
```
caafe_clf = CAAFEClassifier(base_classifier=clf_no_feat_eng,
                      llm_model="gpt-4",
                      iterations=2)
```
Then, fit the classifier to your training data:
```
caafe_clf.fit_pandas(df_train,
               target_column_name=target_column_name,
               dataset_description=dataset_description,
              disable_caafe=False 
              )
```
Finally, use the classifier to make predictions on your test data:
```
pred = caafe_clf.predict(df_test)
```
View generated features:
```
print(caafe_clf.code)
```

### Important Usage Considerations

#### Code Execution
Executing AI-generated code automatically poses inherent risks. These include potential misuse by bad actors or unforeseen outcomes when AI systems operate outside of their typical, controlled environments. In developing our approach, we have taken insights from research on AI code generation and cybersecurity into account. We scrutinize the syntax of the Python code generated by the AI and employ a whitelist of operations allowed for execution. However, certain operations such as imports, arbitrary function calls, and others are not permitted. While this increases security, it's not a complete solution – for example, it does not prevent operations that could result in infinite loops or excessive resource usage, like loops and list comprehensions. We continually work to improve these limitations.

#### Replication of Biases
It's important to note that AI algorithms can often replicate and even perpetuate biases found in their training data. CAAFE, which is built on GPT-4, is not exempt from this issue. The model has been trained on a vast array of web crawled data, which inevitably contains biases inherent in society. This implies that the generated features may also reflect these biases. If the data contains demographic information or other sensitive variables that could potentially be used to discriminate against certain groups, we strongly advise against using CAAFE or urge users to proceed with great caution, ensuring rigorous examination of the generated features.
